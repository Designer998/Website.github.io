<p>
Non-Fiction books are just true stories that have been published and sold. Non-Fiction books range from intense, miraculous, and exhilarating to just plain facts. Both of the books i put on this page are just plain facts and theories and a mix of both.They can be very interesting, or very complicated. However so, they were published because someone thought or persisted that it needs to be known to the rest of the world. So they usually have important themes in them (besides the science types).
