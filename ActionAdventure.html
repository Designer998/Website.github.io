<alt=“Ender's Game”>

<p>
Action Adventure books, like i said before, makes your life more lively. 
Ender's Game can be one of the books that can liven you life and experience
 intense action and adventure. This spirit can also make you think about things
you wouldn't otherwise wouldn't have thought of doing. 
</br>
For example:

</div>
<div align="left">

<ul>
<li>hiking</li>
<li>exploring</li>
<li>inventing</li>
<li>read more</li>
</ul>

</p>
</div>

<div align="center">

<p>
All of these you could experience with new ideas and perspective on.
As I've said at the <a href="indexweb.html">Home</a> page, books are 
very important for learning about pretty much everything. Action adventure novels are just 
the same as any other book, there's just a storyline covering some parts of the theme/ideas 
in it.
